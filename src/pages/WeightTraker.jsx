            Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for overall well-being. It
            reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease,
            and certain cancers. A balanced weight improves energy levels,
            mobility, and self-confidence.

            activity, balanced nutrition, and adequate sleep. It also helps
            regulate hormones and supports mental health.
